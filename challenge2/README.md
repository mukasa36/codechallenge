 # Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

 # Description
 The application is used to detect the acceleration rate of a driver which helps in controlling the speed the vehicle is driven with a certain speed which if exceeded there are consequenses as follows 
 f the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.Eg
 f the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

# project setup

var carSpeed = parseInt() ,to input the speed
